RESTful Pizzajoint
==================

This is my take on [students] (https://github.com/smanek/students) by smanek. Its a RESTful Java Web Service for taking pizza orders for a pizzajoint.

The following libraries are used

* Guice - Simplified Server
* JAX-RS - Java API for RESTful Web Services

* Guava - Type Inference, among other things
